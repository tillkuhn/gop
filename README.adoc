= ðŸ¥¶ Let it Go - My Personal Go Playground :vulcan_salute:

== Get started

Get https://golang.org/doc/install[Go] and - most importantly - install the great https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint[golangci-lint]
and follow the advice of their "Bug Gopher"!

== Cobra CLI Usage

=== Install and init Cobra CLI for new Project

----
$ go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra@latest

$ cobra-cli init --author "Till Kuhn"
Your Cobra application is ready at
/Users/tillkuhn/git/hub/letitgo

$ go run main.go
A longer description that spans multiple lines and likely contains
----

=== Add a Cobra Command for existing Project

.Example to add a 'serve' command, this creates a file `cmd/server.go`
----
$ cobra-cli add serve
serve created at /Users/tillkuhn/git/hub/letitgo
----

.Create a dedicated folder / package with at least one .go file for your experiments
----
$ mkdir charts && echo "package charts" >charts/charts.go
printf "package charts\n\nfunc Run() {}" >charts/charts.go
----

.Open ./cmd/<command>.go and call a public function from your new package
----
var chartsCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("charts called")
		charts.Run() // Delegate to package function (1st entry point)
  // (...)
----

.`main()` in `main.go` delegates to Cobra's `Execute()` function in `cmd/root.go`
----
$ cat main.go
func main() {
	cmd.Execute()
}
----

.Run your new command For frequently used command, create a dedicated target in `Makefile`
----
$ go run main.go serve
Running server
----

== Snippets

=== Add recent version of a module

----
$ go get "github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig"
go get: added github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig v1.4.0
----
