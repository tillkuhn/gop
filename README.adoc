=== What is iota?

iota is an identifier that is used with constant and which can simplify constant definitions that use auto-increment numbers. The iota keyword represents integer constant starting from zero.
The iota keyword represents successive integer constants 0, 1, 2,â€¦.It resets to 0 whenever the word const appears in the source code, and increments after each const specification.
